    <h2>Gavin Beus</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Gavin Beus, I am 24 years olds and studying Applied Technology. I am from Pasco, Washington.
        I have been married for almost three years, my wife and I got married in 2020 during the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which was crazy. 
        She is from South Carolina, so our families are pretty far apart haha. She has 8 sibliings and I am the oldest of 3, so our family dynamic
        in terms of number of siblings is quite different as well, but we make it work!
    </p>
       <p>I am taking Applied Technology to learn and gain the necessary skills to become a Web Developer, I eventually want to freelance
        and do work for various companies in the future.I currently have very limited experience with Web Development, so I am excited for 
        this course and the others I will be taking as I pursue my degree. 
    </p> 
    <p>Some things I like to do are play basketball, offroading, travel, fly drones, and 
        edit videos. I look forward to this semester and going through this course with you all!
    </p>
